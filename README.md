# Application

The application was presented as a final project at the end of the programming course.
Project is based on a bootstrap. Built on Maven with all necessary dependencies in the pom.xml file.
I used the knowledge gained in the course. From the area like: Java, Spring, MySQL, JavaScript, Hibernate.
Project includes functionalities such as registration, logging in, and training booking.Also security is in from Spring Security.The registration automatically adds the user as a regular user who, after logging in, has access to the content / userPanel.In the workbench, after adding the users, I gave the roles of administrators who have access to the content / adminPanel.
Administrator manages: users, reservations and trainings. Can add / edit / delete each one.
User can view training as well as sign up for a selected training.
